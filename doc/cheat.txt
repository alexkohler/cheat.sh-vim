How to use it                                             *cheat.sh-how-to-use*

The plugins provides two commands :
>
    :Cheat
    :CheatReplace
<
+ These commands takes 0 or 1 argument.
+ If you give no argument, it will send the language of the current buffer and
the visual selection (or the current line in `normal` mode) as a query to
cheat.sh and show the answer in a new buffer (`:Cheat`) or in place of your
question (`:CheatReplace`).
+ If one argument is given, you can complete it from a list of available cheat
sheets or write your own [query](https://github.com/chubin/cheat.sh#search).
+ There are two mappings `<localeader>KB` and `<leader>KR` (Cheat
Replace) to run these commands without any arguments.

Navigate through answers                                   *cheat.sh-naviguage*

Once you have called on of these commands, you can navigate through answers
with `<leader>KN` (Cheat Next)  `<leader>KP` (Cheat Previous).

You can also directly use the command :
>
    :CheatNaviguate delta
<
Where delta is a numeric value for moving (1, or -1 for next or previous)

+ `<leader>` is usually '\', see |<leader>|
