How to use it                                             *cheat.sh-how-to-use*

The easiest way to use this plugin is to use one of the following mappings :

+ `K` get answer on the word under the cursor or the selection on a pager
+ `<leader>kK` same as `K`
+ `<leader>KB` get the answer on a special buffer
+ `<leader>KR` Replace your question by the answer

The plugins also provides two commands :
>
    :Cheat
    :CheatReplace
<
+ These commands takes 0 or 1 argument.
+ If you give no argument, it will send the language of the current buffer and
the visual selection (or the current line in `normal` mode) as a query to
cheat.sh and show the answer in a new buffer (`:Cheat`) or in place of your
question (`:CheatReplace`).
+ If one argument is given, you can complete it from a list of available cheat
sheets or write your own [query](https://github.com/chubin/cheat.sh#search).
+ There are two mappings `<localeader>KB` and `<leader>KR` (Cheat Replace)
to run these commands without any arguments.

It also adds a `:CheatPager` command that is not designed to be directly used
by the end user. This command is used to lookup cheat sheets instead of calling
`man` when you hit `K` in normal and visual modes.

Navigate through answers                                    *cheat.sh-navigate*

Once you have called on of these commands, you can navigate through questions,
answers and related with the following mappings :

+ `<leader>KQN` Next Question
+ `<leader>KAN` Next Answer
+ `<leader>KSN` Next "See also"
+ `<leader>KQP` Previous Question
+ `<leader>KAP` Previous Answer
+ `<leader>KSP` Previous "See also"

You can also directly use the function :
>
    :call cheat#navigate(delta, type)
<
Where delta is a numeric value for moving (1, or -1 for next or previous)
And type is one of : `'Q'`, `'A'` and `'S'`

For instance :
>
    :call cheat#navigate(-3, 'A')
<
goes back three answers before the current

When navigating, the same mode (pager, buffer, replace) is used as for the last
request.

Notes                                                          *cheat.sh-notes*

+ `<leader>` is usually '\', see |<leader>|
